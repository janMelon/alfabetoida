# alfabetoida
Alfabetoida is a font for writing fake greek texts (also known as "GRSSK", which is the correct transliteration from the common example of GRΣΣΚ). It's a stylized latin alphabet made to look like its greek equivalent while trying to maintain its current pronunciation. Some letter forms from the cyrillic alphabet were also taken as inspiration due to their closer resemblance to greek.

## Modified Letters
Most latin letters still retain the same or a similar form to their the greek counterparts, but others require some adjustments.

* /b/: To avoid current greek pronunciation of ⟨Β/β⟩ that is closer to /v/, a stylized version of the cyrillic ⟨Б⟩ is used instead.
* /d/: Current greek ⟨δ⟩ is pronounced as /ð/. The sound /ð/ is also found in english (commonly written as ⟨th⟩, e.g. "this"), but is often reduced to /d/.
*  
Meanwhile, ⟨v⟩ is stylized to look a bit like a slanted vau a.k.a. digamma ⟨ϝ⟩.

Lower case lambda ⟨λ⟩ is flipped, resembling the symbol for voiced palatal lateral approximant ⟨ʎ⟩, then stylized to look like upper case ⟨L⟩.

A compromise is made between upper case nu ⟨Ν⟩, ⟨N⟩, and cyrillic ⟨Н⟩ by making the mid bar slanted.

The left leg of pi ⟨π⟩ is elongated to make it aligned with lower case ⟨p⟩. 

The loop in rho ⟨ρ⟩ is left incomplete and its leg is shortened, resembling a lower case ⟨r⟩. The loop in lower case phi ⟨φ⟩ is also left incomplete, making it a stylized ⟨f⟩.

The word-final sigma ⟨ς⟩ is chosen due its similarity to latin ⟨s⟩ and cyrillic ⟨с⟩. 



IDEAS FOR OTHER ASCII LETTERS (not used in the conlang)

⟨w⟩ can be stylizing it into a rotated digamma ⟨ϝ⟩, something like ⟨𐡔⟩.

The i-breve ⟨ĭ⟩ can be used for the latin ⟨Y⟩ when it's pronounced as /j/.

The latin ⟨J⟩ can be written as a stylized lower case zeta ⟨ζ⟩ when it is pronounced as /ʤ/.

Upper case ⟨Q⟩ is similar enough to koppa ⟨Ϙ⟩.

The ambiguous pronunciation of latin ⟨c⟩ across languages can be written with an angular ⟨<⟩ to mean /k/ or the word-final sigma ⟨ς⟩ to mean /s/.

The latin ⟨x⟩ (when it's pronounced as /ks/) can be stylized into something resembling a slanted upper case xi ⟨Ξ⟩, something like ⟨٪⟩ or ⟨ミ⟩.
