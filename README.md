# alfabetoida
Alfabetoida is a font for writing fake greek texts (also known as "GRSSK", which is the correct transliteration from the common example of GRΣΣΚ). It's a stylized latin alphabet made to look like its greek equivalent while trying to maintain its current pronunciation. Some letter forms from the cyrillic alphabet were also taken as inspiration due to their closer resemblance to greek.
